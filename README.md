# Website Game Project

this is a platforming game with leaderboard, user registration and login 

the game was a university project coded in pure HTML CSS Javascript as required

the game uses localstorage as a "database", that means all passwords and accounts can be accessed in localstorage tab in developer tools, it also means the data is not shared between browsers and is not uploaded to any server
